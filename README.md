free-books
==========

A repository for free books. The goal of this project is to provide
books that are fun to read and NOT to provide exact copies of the
original books. 

The sense of the texts should not get changed, but I want correct
punctuation and correct spelling of words and no footnotes that 
inform about these corrections.
